%FORMAT_SCATT Formats a scattering representation
%   [out,meta] = format_scat(X,fmt) formats the scattering output X (from
%   the function scatt, or scatt_time with output set to 'raw') according
%   to the format specified in fmt. The following formats are allowed:
%
%      'raw' - No formatting is done and the original object is returned
%      'table' - The scattering coefficients are arranged into a 2D table,
%         with the scattering coefficient index running along the first
%         dimension and time running along the second dimension. This is only
%         possible if the scattering coefficients of different orders are of
%         the same resolution, which is the case when the lowpass filters phi
%         of the filter banks coincide. The signals are ordered by increasing
%         order, increasing first scale, increasing second scale, etc. Their
%         meta-information (order, scale, etc) are stored in the accompanying
%         meta structure. These correspond to the meta structures of X,
%         concatenated, and complemented by -1 when no value is available.
%         In addition, an order field is provided to give the order of the
%         coefficient. For example, if we have ascattering transform of order 
%         2, and the coefficient at index k is the first-order coefficient 
%         with scale j1, it would have meta.order(k) equal to 1 and
%         meta.scale(k,:) equal to [j1 -1]. Likewise if the kth coefficient is
%         a second-order coefficient corresponding to scales j1 and j2, it 
%         would have meta.order(k) equal to 2, and meta.scale(k,:) equal to
%         [j1 j2].
